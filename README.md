# Data-Leakage-Detection-System
To detect when the distributor’s sensitive data has been leaked by agents, and if possible to identify the agent that leaked the data.



FEATURES OF THE PROJECT :
-------------------------

---Data Leakage Detection propose data allocation strategies that improve the probability of identifying leakages.
---It can detect when the distributor’s sensitive data has been leaked by agents and if possible to identify the agent that leaked the data.
---We also present algorithms for distributing objects to agents, in a way that improves our chances of identifying a leaker.

This project was made under the mentorship of Kiran Bidua Madam at MIT ADT University. The team consists of 4 members. The complete project was done within 4-5 months during the semester.
